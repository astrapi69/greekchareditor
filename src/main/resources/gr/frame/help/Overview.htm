<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The tool was designed to convert latin characters in greek characters.
It converts latin characters to greek HTML-entities or "ISO-8859-7"-characters or "greek-unicode"-characters.
The appropriate characters are outputed in the appropriate editors when the "Transform"-Buttons are pushed.
The idea was created when we was looking for a tool in the internet that offer this functionality.
Cause at that time we not found such a tool we decided to programm.
The tool is intended for Webdesigner who need to put greek characters in the HTML-file.</p>
